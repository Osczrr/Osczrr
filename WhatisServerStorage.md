<h2 align="center">What is a Storage Server</h2>

---
<h5>A storage server is a type of server used to manage, secure, store and access content that is used on the server.
<br></br>
Storage servers allow data to be monitered and sorted easier then any alternative (which there aren't many)
<br></br>
Storage servers are useful when large amounts of data is required to be stored. Many small servers use a single computer to store the data but this is very inconvienent because that data can only be accessed on that single computer whereas if you had a storage server, data could be accessed through any authorized device on a network.
