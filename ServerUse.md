<h2 align="center">How Servers can be used</h2>

---

<h5>Servers have many different uses but it all boils down to that they manage network resources. 
 <br></br> 
 The server is able to serve the information to any authorized computer that connects to it.
 <br></br> 
 Servers are able to store, send, receive, protect, configure and allocate data.
  <br></br> 
  But there is so much more a server can do it and it just depends on how the server creator/user wants to use it</h5>
