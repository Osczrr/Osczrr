<h2 align="center">The History of Servers</h2>

---
<h5>Servers have been around for a very long time. The word server was related to computing before the internet we know today existed and it seperated the server and user host from eachother.
As the internet grew and expanded, so did the meaning of the word server. As you've seen there are now many different servers and uses for servers that will continue to grow
as we gain more technology in the future.</h5>
