<h2 align="center">How Files are transferred</h2>

---
<h5> Files Are transferred using a communication protocol called File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
<br></br>
FTP establishes a connection between the client and server, transferres the files and then closes the connection.
<br></br>
File transfer can be protected by locking files from being transferred without entering a login or other authorization
<br></br>
